# get_next_line
The goal of this project is to make you code a function that reads file from file descriptor and retruns *one line ending with a new line('/n')* without knowing the size beforehand. This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables. You will also gain a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.

## Prototype 
int	get_next_line(int fd, char **line);
